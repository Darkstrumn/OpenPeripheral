Compiling
=======

(Linux and Mac)

You will need Apache Ant and Git.

Run: git clone git://github.com/OpenMods/OpenPeripheral; && cd OpenPeripheral

It should download the repository and cd into the repository.

Next, run: ant

It should find the Buildfile and start downloading Forge and MCP.

It will start decompiling Minecraft and then after a few minutes there should be a file called 'OpenPeripheral-VERSION.jar' in bin/. That is the compiled version of OpenPeripheral.
